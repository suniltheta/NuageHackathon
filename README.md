##Client side

Code just contains simple java file. which will make http requests to servers.

All server related file can be found under Server Codes folder. pom.xml contains maven dependancies. These servers respond to simple http requests with x value.

Server side was developed using Spring sts, but have little trouble configuring them to run on tomcat
